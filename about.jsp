<h1>ABOUT US </h1>
The Student Housing Management System aims to connect renting students and property owner of Houses in an easy-to-use system that allows renting stuents to be able to easily find 
houses and find somewhere to stay while attending school.Houses, and most forms of off-campus living are very expensive.  It can be very difficult for students, especially foreign students, to find affordable places to live. SHM seeks to solve this problem by providing systems that students can use to aid in the search of booking houses so they can focus on what is most important to them, their education.  The goal of SHM is to help reduce some of the many stresses that forstudents face when having to leave their country or state to attend their desired schools.  We as a company do not want students to be limited on what they can afford and want to help them save as much as we can because we understand the more money, they can put towards their education increases their chances of success.
